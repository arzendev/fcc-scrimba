# "Learn React" code-along

Coding along to the "Learn React" frontend development course taught by Bob Ziroll.

This repository includes all the source files for projects built with the help of the course's video lectures as well as my own solo projects.

The course available for free at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8).
